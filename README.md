# About me
Hello! My name is Hristian, a Computer Science student from Bulgaria with a concentration in Software Engineering. I hold a degree in Environmental Studies as well.

My goal is to merge my expertise in environmental studies and software engineering to enhance people's lives. I am deeply passionate about geospatial technology and am eager to master all aspects of it. My ambition is to develop environmentally-focused software that makes a significant, positive impact on the world.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy spending time with friends, gaming, and unwinding from the demands of my studies. I believe in balancing hard work with good times, and I find that stepping back often provides fresh perspectives on challenging problems.
